Homework involves assembling your constructor from various parts and making it all work together by scripting in Python. Your main challenge will focus on optimizing for performance and determining which features to prioritize for speed.

**Project Structure**

Recommended Constructor Details:

1) **LLM Deployment:** It's convenient to use `llama.cpp` (https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) or `ollama` (https://ollama.com/). APIs from Replicate or OpenAI can also be explored, or you can set up your own model. Starting with simpler models like Gemma-2b or quantized 7b or 13b is advisable due to their lower computational demands. Remember to balance API speed and cost.
2) **A Wake Word:** Utilize [Choosing a Wake Word](https://picovoice.ai/docs/tips/choosing-a-wake-word/) with options like Athena in Italian model for consistent voice recognition. Whisper could also be an alternative for wake word detection.
3) **Voice Recognition:** Employ various versions of Whisper for efficient and robust voice recognition capabilities:
   - https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp
   - https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper
   - https://replicate.com/vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper?input=cog
   Ensure you check out installation guides for necessary codecs.
4) **Voice Generation:** Explore voice synthesis technologies to create natural-sounding speech:
   - https://replicate.com/cjwbw/openvoice
   - https://replicate.com/lucataco/xtts-v2
5) **Dialogue Logic:** Writing your own logic or using platforms like LangChain (https://www.langchain.com/) can enhance conversational capabilities.
6) **Memory Organization:** Use tools like LlamaIndex (https://www.llamaindex.ai/) for memory organization or again, LangChain for integrating memory into dialogue systems.
7) **Lip Sync:** Use technologies like wav2lip for lip-syncing. Consider recent forks for improved performance.

**Assessment**

* **Video with Demonstration:** Submit your video demonstrating your Jarvis.
* **Project Code:** Submit your code demonstrating the implementation.

**Tips**

* **Start Simple:** Begin with a small set of functions. E.g., start only with LLM chat or only STT.
* **Iterate:** Gradually introduce more complex parts.

**Important Notes**

* **Computational Resources:** Whisper LLM and Gemma-2b can be computationally light, but other parts probably can be heavy.

Let me know if you'd like adjustments in difficulty level or would like to focus on specific aspects of these technologies!

Later I will share the reference implementation.
